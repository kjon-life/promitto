# The purpose of this project
It takes some work to establish **reputation**. This project is an ongoing exploration of reputation in a web3 context, beginning with an x clone in Rust.

## Where we are

* Toolchain, installed. 
* Project skeleton, done.
* IDE, ready.  

Next: Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

## Where we started
Backend developer who has read The Rust Book, and wants to move beyond the knowledge available in the ecosystem.
I'm a solutions consultant in startup to enterprise SaaS, a pre-sales manager, an avocational product manager, and git push
I love conversations that lead to clarity of action, improved quality, and more joy.
